# Harvest Jira Plugin

Adds a Harvest time tracking extension to JIRA, ZAMMAD and GITLAB issues (Active sprints page, issue page). No synchronization to the webpage is done, all data stays in Harvest.

# Why
The [official harvest-jira integration](https://www.getharvest.com/apps-and-integrations/jira) is done via a [jira plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211628/harvest-time-tracking-official?hosting=cloud&tab=reviews) - which might not be possible or desirable in some cases (for example you don't have an admin account on your client's jira instance).

# How
Select the ticket, then click on the extension icon in the upper right corner.
