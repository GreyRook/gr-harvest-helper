# Harvest Issue Board Plugin

This extension adds a Harvest time tracking button for Jira, Zammad and GitLab issues (active sprints page, issue page). No synchronization to the webpage is done, all data stays in Harvest.

# Usage
Select the ticket, then click on the extension icon in the upper right corner. A popup will open where you can specify project and task and set the desired starting time (which defaults to now). A permanent link to the selected issue will be added to the Harvest item automatically.

Earlier versions of this plugin displayed a time tracking button on Jira â€” this got removed. [Details](docs/on-page-tracker.md).
